### Brief summary 

Wikipedia is a free Internet-based encyclopedia that is built and maintained via the 
open-source collaboration of a community of volunteers. Wikipedia’s purpose is to benefit 
readers by acting as a widely accessible and free encyclopedia, a comprehensive written 
synopsis that contains information on all discovered branches of knowledge. Unfortunately, 
given its open-editing format, Wikipedia is highly vulnerable to malicious activity, 
including vandalism, spam, undisclosed paid editing, etc. 
Malicious users often use sockpuppet accounts to circumvent a block or a ban 
imposed by Wikipedia administrators on the person’s original account. A sockpuppet is  an 
“online identity used for the purpose of deception.” Usually, several sockpuppet accounts 
are controlled by a unique individual (or entity) called a puppetmaster. 
Currently,  suspected sockpuppet accounts are manually verified by Wikipedia 
administrators, which makes the process slow and inefficient. 
The primary objective of this research is to develop an automated ML and neural-
network-based system to recognize the patterns of sockpuppet accounts as early as possible 
and recommend suspension.
